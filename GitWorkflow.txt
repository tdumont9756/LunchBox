Git Workflow:

Since for the time being, I will be the only one working on the project, I will keep it fairly simple.  If in the 
event that more people join on, I will implement a more indepth workflow that best fits the project.

Branches:

Master Branch:
1) Master will be the projection ready code.  
2) This is the code that will be put into production on the server
3) Hotfixes will pull directly from Master Branch and merge back into it.
4) Stage will pull from this branch and merge into master on release

Stage:
1) Stage is where code waits for release.  
2) It is where Dev branchs will pull from
3) Once all testing is done and I confirm that stage is stable, it merges into master.

Dev Branches:
1) These are genral purpose development branches. 
2) Cut a new branch to work on a ticket, issue, exc
3) After testing code, it is moved back into stage to await release

Hotfix Branch:
1) These are cut from Master in the event that there is a hotfix that needs to be implemented. 
2) Work is done one the hotfix branch and then merged back into master and into stage
